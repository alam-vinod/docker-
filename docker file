here we can store the data perminent and we can change here what ever we want 
once we write on docker file all the needs

below we can show docker file life cycle
DOCKERFILE >> DOCKER IMAGE >> DOCKER CONTAINER 
 in docker file we should be user capital letters only for commands

 ex : FROM ubuntu
 RUN  :: here we can run linux and bash commands 
 RUN apt install java -y or mkdir vinod or mkdir tomcat
 CMD  :: its providing default commands while install a new container and also we can overwrite the command
 while we are giving any script we can run "/opt/tomcat/bin/catalin.sh" this is a script . if we want to run this script we use "RUN" command.
 CMD["/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh","RUN"]
